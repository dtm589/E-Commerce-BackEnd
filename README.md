# E Commerce Database

## Description
This Node.js application facilitates the creation, reading, updating, and deleting of a database. It uses the third-party Node.js module called Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. When the user makes hits to certain API the program will update the database in many ways. You can also use certain API to show the data that is in the database. I believe that this program shows what I have learned about databases and JavaScript.
